        <h3>Overview</h3>
        <p>My name is Shandy Kim, and I'm a rising junior at the University of Washington (Seattle) studying computer science. I grew up in Tacoma, WA but currently live in Snoqualmie, WA.
            My talents include sleeping late for no reason (and regretting it the next morning) and playing the ukulele.</p>
        <p>I got interested in computer science through game development. In high school, I thought that game development was a way for me to combine both programming and 
            art. I am no longer trying to pursue a career in game development, but I am exploring other areas in computer science, such as systems. I hope to learn a lot about web dev
            from STEP!</p>

        <p>Here are fun facts about me:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>I am the oldest out of three kids</li>
            <li>My first programming language was Python</li>
            <li>My favorite game is <em>Fallout: New Vegas</em></li>
            <li>I hate raw tomatoes with a great passion</li>
            <li>I firmly believe there is a <em>Spongebob</em> quote for every situation</li>
        </ul>

          <h3>Favorite Projects I Have Worked On</h3>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>xk OS:</strong> Last quarter, I took a class on operating systems. Throughout the quarter, a partner and I worked on implementing features of the barebones 
            starter OS called xk. We implemented various features such as file creation, pipes, and copy-on-write fork. It was a painful but rewarding experience.</li>
            <li><strong>Dog Aging Project (DAP):</strong> One of the projects I enjoyed working on for the DAP was creating a SQL stored procedure to periodically deduplicate 
            participants records.</li>
            <li><strong>Dogger:</strong> In my senior year of high school, I had the chance to take an online course on game development. The game <em>Dogger</em> was created from a two 
            week game jam. It is a play on the classic game <em>Frogger</em>, where you play as a dog crossing the road to catch a chicken. I worked on the UI, powerups, and 
            movement for the dog. You can play it at <a href="https://www.itch.io" target="_blank">here</a>.</li>
          </ul>

        <h3>Pet: Luci</h3>
        <p>My family has a pet dog named Luci. She's a Korean Jindo and is around 1 1/2 years old. Her favorite activities are chasing local rabbits and meeting new people.
            One great thing about her is that she rarely barks, so no need to worry about noise complaints!</p>

        <h3>Pacific Northwest</h3>
        <p>Washington state is known for its nature scenery and its connections with serial killers (I kid you not humans remains were found at a Seattle beach a few days ago). 
            In the PNW, the ocean, forests, mountains, and even deserts are within reach. I live in western Washington, so forests and hiking trails are easy to access.
            Here are a few pictures I've taken of the PNW:</p>
